## Description
My motivation to pursue Software Development was due to a class elective I took on Coding & Robotics years ago. After that school year ended I found myself extremely invested into learning more about the field.
I made this little about me project so that when I do expand my portfolio there will evidence of my improvement and growth of learning how to code.
So far I already learned C, and am currently learning Web Development and Intermediate Programming.
